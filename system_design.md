System Design Document:

Data Collection Layer: Collects data from transactional databases or retail data sources.
Data Processing Pipeline: An ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process that prepares data for analysis by handling missing values, standardizing features, and encoding categorical data.
Modeling Layer: Machine Learning models for clustering (such as K-Means or DBSCAN) and recommendation (e.g., collaborative filtering or content-based filtering).
Deployment Layer: An API or front-end interface that delivers recommendations to customers in real-time or near real-time.
